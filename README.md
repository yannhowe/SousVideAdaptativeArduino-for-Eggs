SousVideAdaptativeArduino - for Eggs
=========================

Adaptative regulation sous-vide cooker algorithm (for arduino)

Just for eggs! No need for display, no need for buttons, no need for setting temperature.

Intro
=========================

Forked from the code here - egiust/SousVideAdaptativeArduin

Modified to just make eggs for my wife in the morning predictably.
